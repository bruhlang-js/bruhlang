# BruhLang

Super super simple language made in JavaScript, inspired by brainfuck, but instead you can play around with strings.


**Example:**


```
// logs "hello world"
hello world

// logs "oo"
o+o

// logs "hello worldd"
hello world.d
```

# Operators

`+` - Concatenates the previous character and the next character. (might be buggy with spaces)

`.` - Repeats the previous Character
